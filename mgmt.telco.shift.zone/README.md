# Telco Managment Cluster

The Telco management cluster must be OCP 4.8.x and be deployed using one of the following methods:

- Assisted Installer / Assisted Service Operator mode
- Baremetal IPI mode

These method are the only methods that deploy and configure the `cluster-baremetal-operator` in the cluster which is a requirement for some of the automation flows.

**NOTE:** Due to `BZ-1953979` the minimum version for mgmt cluster is `4.8.0-0.nightly-2021-05-31-085539`

##

On the cluster is deployed using one of the valid deployment methods for Telco Management Clusters, this cluster has one or many additional disks on the worker nodes (for example 100G vdb in this case) in order to install Local Storage Operator.

```bash
export KUBECONFIG="~/path/to/kubeconfig-telco-mgmt"
export TELCO_MGMT_PATH="~/path/to/this/path"
oc apply -k $TELCO_MGMT_PATH
```

- Sample run from a drectory containing a copy of this repository.

```bash
# "oc" should have access to the management cluster 
$ oc whoami --show-server
https://api.mgmt.telco.shift.zone:6443

# label all nodes for LSO
$ oc label node -l kubernetes.io/os=linux ran.openshift.io/lso=''
node/m0 labeled
node/m1 labeled
node/m2 labeled

# apply role to 
$ oc apply -k .

error: unable to recognize ".": no matches for kind "MultiClusterHub" in version "operator.open-cluster-management.io/v1"
```

- Ignore the "no matches for kind '...<a_kind_here>...' " errors. The reason for these is that the Operators are installing but the deployment has not compelted by the time it tries to configure the CRs in the first run.
  - Once the Operators are installed rerun the `oc apply -k .`
- Disconnection for the ingressVIP and apiVIP might be experienced as the configuration is modifying the corresponding operator configuration. There is a rolling update that is also kickstarted by any MCO configuration update applied to nodes. After few minutes the base configuration should be completed
- (optional) Set a default storageclass

    ```bash
    # set lso-filesystemclass as default
    oc patch storageclass lso-filesystemclass \
    -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"true"}}}'
    ```

- Create secret from pull-secret for Assisted Installer Operator

    ```bash
    oc create secret generic assisted-deployment-pull-secret -n assisted-installer \
    --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=pull-secret.json --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
    ```

- Patch metal3 so it can see all the `bmh` resources in all namespaces:
  
    ```bash
    oc patch provisioning provisioning-configuration --type merge -p '{"spec":{"watchAllNamespaces": true}}'
    ```
- To obtain the password for `telco-gitops` ArgoCD `admin`
  
    ```bash
    oc get secret telco-gitops-cluster -n telco-gitops -o go-template='{{index .data "admin.password"}}' | base64 -d
    ```

## Define a cluster for ArgoCD

After a management cluster is deployed, before using ArgoCD for day-2 GitOps configurations, the cluster credentials must be defined in ArgoCD.

```bash
# Linux argocd CLI 
curl -L -o argocd https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/download/v2.0.5/argocd-linux-amd64

# MacOS argocd CLI
curl -L -o argocd https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/download/v2.0.5/argocd-darwin-amd64
```

- Login into the ArgoCD instance in the management cluster using ArgoCD CLI. You will be prompted for the ArgoCD `admin` password.

    ```bash
    # First get the route for the argocd app
    oc get route -n telco-gitops
    argocd login {ROUTE FROM ABOVE} --name admin
    ```

- List clusters
  
    ```bash
    $ argocd cluster list
    SERVER                                  NAME        VERSION  STATUS      MESSAGE
    https://kubernetes.default.svc          in-cluster  1.21+    Successful
    ```

- Add target cluster (assumes target cluster already deployed)

    ```bash
    $ argocd cluster add --kubeconfig ~/kubeconfig-telco-core admin --name telco-core
    INFO[0000] ServiceAccount "argocd-manager" created in namespace "kube-system"
    INFO[0000] ClusterRole "argocd-manager-role" created
    INFO[0000] ClusterRoleBinding "argocd-manager-role-binding" created
    Cluster 'https://api.core.telco.shift.zone:6443' added
    ```

- Validate cluster has been defined

    ```bash
    argocd cluster list
    SERVER                                  NAME        VERSION  STATUS      MESSAGE
    https://api.core.telco.shift.zone:6443  telco-core  1.20     Successful
    https://kubernetes.default.svc          in-cluster  1.21+    Successful
    ```
